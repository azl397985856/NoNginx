## Intro
FrontEnd devers can fetch data from mockServer when they devs locally . But it's time to get out of the greehouse when they have to make a integrated test with the backend. We didnt wanna rely on others as usual, but now we have to face.
that 's a proxy to dispatch all the requests including static assets and backend endpoints at dev-env
