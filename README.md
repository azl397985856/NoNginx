# NoNginx

Front to backEnd integrated test web page.
FrontEnd devers can fetch data from mockServer when they devs locally . But it's time to get out of the greehouse when they have to make a integrated test with the backend. We didnt wanna rely on others as usual, but now we have to face.
So I built that web page for you.  What you should do is just inputing the address of the backend, and click the button.(allright, i confess, you have connect to my express server first!)
